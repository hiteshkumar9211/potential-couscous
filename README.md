Dynamic Programming Simulator
This project is a web-based application that simulates three dynamic programming algorithms: Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication, and 0/1 Knapsack. The user can select which problem to solve, input the necessary data, and solve the problem using dynamic programming.

Getting Started
To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The application will be displayed in the browser window.

Usage
When the application is opened, the user is presented with a dropdown menu to select which problem to solve. After selecting a problem, the appropriate input fields are displayed for the user to enter the necessary data.

For Longest Common Subsequence, the user inputs two sequences of characters.

For Matrix Chain Multiplication, the user inputs a sequence of integers representing the dimensions of matrices.

For 0/1 Knapsack, the user inputs the capacity of the knapsack and a list of items in the format of "weight, value" on separate lines.

After entering the data, the user clicks the "Solve" button to solve the problem using dynamic programming. The solution is displayed below the input fields.
