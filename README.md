Introduction
This project is a dynamic programming simulator that provides a visual and interactive way of solving problems. It is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to run on modern web browsers. The simulator currently includes three problems: Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication, and 0/1 Knapsack.

Getting Started
To run the simulator, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The simulator should load, and you will be presented with a menu to select a problem to solve.

Usage
The simulator is very simple to use. Once you have selected a problem, you will be presented with an input form. Enter the input values for the problem and click the "Solve" button. The simulator will then compute and display the solution.

Supported Problems
The simulator currently supports the following problems:

Longest Common Subsequence - Given two sequences, find the length of their longest common subsequence.

Matrix Chain Multiplication - Given a sequence of matrices, find the minimum number of scalar multiplications required to multiply them together.

0/1 Knapsack - Given a list of items with their weights and values, find the maximum value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items such that their total weight does not exceed a given limit.

Project Structure
The project includes the following files:

index.html - The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the simulator.

style.css - The CSS file that contains the styles for the HTML elements.

app.js - The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the simulator.

Conclusion
The Dynamic Programming Simulator is a useful tool for solving dynamic programming problems. It provides a visual and interactive way of solving problems, which can be helpful for understanding and learning the concepts of dynamic programming. The simulator is open-source and can be modified and extended to support more problems and features. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact us.
